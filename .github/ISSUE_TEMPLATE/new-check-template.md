*Try to respond to as many of the following as possible*

**Suggest specific syntax or pattern(s) that should trigger the linter** *(e.g., `.iat`)*


**Suggest specific syntax or pattern(s) that the linter should allow** *(e.g., `.iloc`)*


**Suggest a specific error message that the linter should display** *(e.g., "Use '.iloc' instead of '.iat'. If speed is important, use numpy indexing")*


**Are you willing to try to implement this check?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
